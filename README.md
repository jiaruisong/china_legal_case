# China's Urban-Rural Disparities in Legal Resources: A Data-Driven Approach

**Project Lead:** Rey Jiarui Song, Nanqin Ying, UC Berkeley  
**Duration:** 2024 - Present

## About the Project

This project employs advanced data analysis techniques to investigate the disparities in legal resources between urban and rural areas in China. By analyzing over 50 million judicial cases, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and insights that could inform policy and legal practice.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For general programming and data manipulation.
- **Jieba & HanLP**: Chinese text segmentation tools critical for processing judicial case texts.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing and querying the judicial cases.
- **PyTorch**: Employed for machine learning models, particularly in NLP tasks.
- **Azure & Databricks**: Used for cloud computing and big data processing, enabling scalable analysis.

## Objectives

- **Machine Learning & NLP**: Utilize these technologies to process and analyze the vast amount of text data contained within judicial case documents.
- **LLM Deployment**: Leverage Large Language Models (LLM) to identify and compare similar cases, enhancing the analytical depth.

## Contribution

This project is open for collaboration. If you have expertise in computer science, data science, law, or any related field, and are interested in contributing to a meaningful analysis of legal resource disparity, please reach out.
