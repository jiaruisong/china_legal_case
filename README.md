# Leveraging Large Language Models for Analyzing Judicial Disparities in China

**Project Leads:** Rey (Jiarui) Song, Nanqin Ying  
**Duration:** 2024 - Present

## About the Project

This initiative utilizes big data and LLMs to quantify and address disparities in legal representation and outcomes within China's vast legal system. Through a dataset comprising 290,000 drug-related cases, our project explores the influence of lawyers on judicial decisions across varying economic and geographical contexts in China.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation.
- **Claude3 Haiku**: A newer LLM for efficient extraction of data from complex legal texts.
- **Azure Databricks & PySpark**: Used for scalable big data processing and analytics.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Manages data integration services to orchestrate and automate data movement and data transformation.

## Objectives

- **Data-Driven Legal Analysis**: Apply LLMs to extract and analyze data from judicial case texts to better understand legal disparities.
- **Policy Impact**: Generate insights to inform policy and improve legal equity across urban and rural areas.

## Methodology

- **Case Selection**: Identify cases that can be comparably analyzed across regions.
- **Data Extraction**: Use Claude3 Haiku for high-speed, cost-effective text processing.
- **Regression Analysis**: Examine the impact of variables like lawyer presence, region, GDP, and judicial charges on sentencing outcomes.

## Research Questions

How does the presence of legal representation correlate with sentencing across different regions of China? What are the temporal and geographic patterns in the judicial treatment of drug-related offenses?

## Results and Observations

- **Geographic and Economic Disparities**: We observe significant variations in legal outcomes based on geographic and economic contexts.
- **Temporal Consistency**: The influence of legal representation appears consistent over time within the same cities, suggesting stable local judicial practices.
- **Role of Lawyers**: In regions with better access to legal services, lawyers significantly impact the mitigation of sentences.

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Complexity of Legal Texts**: High variability in the accuracy of data extraction, with essential details like drug type and amount being particularly challenging.
- **Cost of LLM Deployment**: Balancing the cost and accuracy of using LLMs for data extraction, with a project budget of approximately $37,000.

## Future Directions

- **Enhancing Model Accuracy**: Improve the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in legal text analysis.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Utilize findings to advocate for increased legal resources in underserved areas.

## Contribution

We invite collaboration from individuals in fields such as data science, law, and public policy who are interested in leveraging technology to enhance judicial fairness and effectiveness.
